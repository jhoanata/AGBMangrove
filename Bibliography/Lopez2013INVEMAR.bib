abstract = {In Colombia, Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) has been implemented through the " National Environmental Policy of the Oceanic Spaces and Coastal and Insular Areas of Colombia-PNAOCI " (Acronyms in Spanish), whose guidelines have considered the need to include marine and coastal ecosystems in land use planning. ICZM, as a special planning approach, can contribute to territorial land use planning of the municipalities located in coastal areas, because it can provide guidelines for the conservation and use of ecosystems in these areas. In this work, the Colombian Pacific coastal area municipalities, which are part of the " Tropical Eastern Pacific Region " and are located between the 01°30{\'{a}}nd the 07°10{\'{i}}atitude North and between the 77°40{\'{a}}nd the 82°00{\'{i}}ongitude West were taken as a study case. The review of their territorial land use plans was made for each one of the municipalities by means of the descriptive analysis of the biophysical, socio-economical and institutional components, seeking to explain, through the different criteria and particular and critical parameters of the coastal-marine areas, the aspects these municipalities must consider and adjust in their territorial land use planning. The criteria selected are related with aspects such as: existence of the territorial land use plan, demarcation of the coastal area, diagnosis (those aspects such as the identification of strategic marine and coastal ecosystems, high impact natural phenomenon i.e. Tsunamis, coastal erosion, oceanographic process, uses, conflicts, risk and governability aspects), zoning and prospecting. The analysis concludes that the ICZM´s principles incorporated to the territorial land use planning processes in the Colombian Pacific could be the opportunity to minimize impacts from land to sea, and generate space.},
