@article{Anaya2009,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a method to increase the level of detail of aboveground biomass estimates at a regional scale. Methods are based on empirical relationships while materials are based on MODIS products and field measurements; the area covers from 4$\,^{\circ}$ south up to 12$\,^{\circ}$ north of the Equator with a total of 1,139,012 km 2 corresponding to the continental area of Colombia. Vegetation was classified in three broad classes: grasslands, secondary forests and primary forests which have been proved to enhance biomass estimates. MOD44 vegetation continuous fields (VCFs) was used as an explanatory variable for primary and secondary forests following an exponential relationship, while MOD13A1 enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as explanatory variable for grasslands following a linear relationship; biomass for this vegetation class was estimated every 16 days given its large variation throughout the year. EVI-biomass relationships were established from 2001 to 2006. Vegetation maps were used to separate primary forests from secondary forest, since the latter has shown lower biomass levels. Confidence intervals of the exponential regression are larger as the biomass values increases, for this reason the uncertainty is quite high ranging from 3.7 to 25.2 millions of Mg with a mean of 16.2 million of Mg. Despite the uncertainty our biomass results are within the estimates of previous studies. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Polania2015,
	Abstract = {Mangroves are plant associations that are easily adapted to saline conditions and fluctuating levels of flooding. This ecosystem provides a wide variety of goods and services as carbon storage. Structural dif- ferences, species composition and micro-environmental characteristics between physiographic types involve differences in carbon storage in their soils. This research aimed to identify the variation of mangrove species through changes in the physical-biotic variables of mangrove forest of Cispat\'{a} bay, Colombia. We measured structural variables of forest (D, H, density of individuals) as well as physico-biotic variables (flood level, A. aureum coverage, water interstitial salinity, soil pH, \% N, \% COs, roots and apparent density soil) in 12 plots established randomly. With a CCA it was identified three mangroves: basin, fringe in good condition and fringe with anthropogenic intervention. The first was dominated by A. germinans and the others by R. mangle. The basin mangrove differs from fringe in physical-biotic variables and structurally, it presented the highest values of COs, salinity, apparent density and pH. Although the two fringe mangrove exhibit similar physical-biotic variables, human disturbance may strongly change the structure of one of them. It was concluded that the dis- tribution of mangrove species of bay responds to a spatial variation in environmental characteristics. However, anthropogenic intervention is a determining variable in the structure of mangroves which affects estimations of the role of different types of mangrove forests as carbon sinks.},

	Abstract = {A common paradigm when the reduction of emissions from deforestations is estimated for the purpose of promoting it as a mitigation option in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is that high uncertainties in input data---i.e., area change and C stock change/area---may seriously undermine the credibility of the estimates and therefore of reduced deforestation as a mitigation option. In this paper, we show how a series of concepts and methodological tools---already existing in UNFCCC decisions and IPCC guidance documents---may greatly help to deal with the uncertainties of the estimates of reduced emissions from deforestation.},

@article{Maniatis2010,
	Abstract = {Background: Developing countries that are willing to participate in the recently adopted (16th Session of the Conference of Parties (COP) in Cancun) mitigation mechanism of Reducing emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation - and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+) - will have to establish a national forest monitoring system in order to assess anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks. Such a system should support the Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) requirement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the REDD+ mechanism is results-based. A national forest inventory (NFI) is one potential key component of such an MRV system. Following the Decision adopted during the 15th Session of the COP in Copenhagen, the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidance and Guidelines should be used as a basis for estimating anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks and changes in forest carbon stocks and area. Results: First, we present the key indispensable elements of the IPCC Guidance and Guidelines that have been developed to fulfil the UNFCCC reporting requirements. This is done in order to set the framework to develop the MRV requirement in which a NFI for REDD+ implementation could be developed. Second, within this framework, we develop and propose a novel scheme for the stratification of forest land for REDD+. Finally, we present some non-exhaustive optional elements within this framework that a country could consider to successfully operationalise and implement its REDD+ NFI. Conclusion: Evidently, both the methodological guidance and political decisions on REDD+ under the UNFCCC will continue to evolve. Even so, and considering that there exists decades of experience in setting up traditional NFIs, developing a NFI that a country may use to directly support REDD+ activities under the UNFCCC represents the development of a new challenge in this field. It is therefore important that both the scientific community and national implementing agencies acquaint themselves with both the context and content of this challenge so that REDD+ mitigation actions may be implemented successfully and with environmental integrity. This paper provides important contributions to the subject through our proposal of the stratification of forest land for REDD+.},

@article{Kristensen2008,
	Abstract = {Our current knowledge on production, composition, transport, pathways and transformations of organic carbon in tropical mangrove environments is reviewed and discussed. Organic carbon entering mangrove foodwebs is either produced autochthonously or imported by tides and/or rivers. Mangrove litter and benthic microalgae are usually the most important autochthonous carbon sources. Depending on local conditions, phytoplankton and seagrass detritus imported with tides may represent a significant supplementary carbon input. Litter handling by the fauna not only affects microbial carbon transformations, but also the amount of organic carbon available for export. Most mangrove detritus that enters the sediment is degraded by microorganisms. Aerobic respiration and anaerobic sulfate reduction are usually considered the most important microbial respiration processes, but recent evidence suggests that iron respiration may be important in mangrove sediments as well. Organic carbon that escapes microbial degradation is stored in sediments and in some mangrove ecosystems, organic-rich sediments may extend to several meters depth. Many mangrove forests also lose a significant fraction of their net primary production to coastal waters. Large differences occur between mangrove forests with respect to litter production and export. Mangrove-derived \{DOC\} is also released into the water column and can add to the total organic carbon export. Numerous compounds have been characterized from mangrove tissues, including carbohydrates, amino acids, lignin-derived phenols, tannins, fatty acids, triterpenoids and n-alkanes. Many of these may, together with stable isotopes, exhibit a strong source signature and are potentially useful tracers of mangrove-derived organic matter. Our knowledge on mangrove carbon dynamics has improved considerably in recent years, but there are still significant gaps and shortcomings. These are emphasized and relevant research directions are suggested. },

	Abstract = {The goods and services that mangrove forests provide to society are widely understood but may be too generally stated to serve as useful guidelines in decision-making. Understanding the differences between fringe, riverine, and basin forests may help to focus these guidelines and to determine the best use of a particular forest. Fringe mangroves are important primarily for shoreline protection. Riverine forests, which are likely to be the most productive of the three types of forests, are particularly important to animal and plant productivity, perhaps because of high nutrient concentrations associated with sediment trapping. Basin forests serve as nutrient sinks for both natural and anthropogenically enhanced ecosystem processes and are often important sources of wood products. Exploitation of a forest for one particular reason may make it incapable of providing other goods and services.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Mangroves are globally important carbon stores and as such have potential for inclusion in future forest-based climate change mitigation strategies such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). Participation in REDD+ will require developing countries to produce robust estimates of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) accompanied by an appropriate measure of uncertainty. Final estimates of \{AGB\} should account for known sources of uncertainty (measurement and predictive) particularly when estimating \{AGB\} at large spatial scales. In this study, mixed-effects models were used to account for variability in the allometric relationship of Kenyan mangroves due to species and site effects. A generic biomass equation for Kenyan mangroves was produced in addition to a set of species-site specific equations. The generic equation has potential for broad application as it can be used to predict the \{AGB\} of new trees where there is no pre-existing knowledge of the specific species-site allometric relationship: the most commonly encountered scenario in practical biomass studies. Predictions of \{AGB\} using the mixed-effects model showed good correspondence with the original observed values of \{AGB\} although displayed a poorer fit at higher \{AGB\} values, suggesting caution in extrapolation. A strong relationship was found between the observed and predicted values of \{AGB\} using an independent validation dataset from the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique (R2 = 0.96, p = &lt; 0.001). The simulation based approach to uncertainty propagation employed in the current study produced estimates of \{AGB\} at different spatial scales (tree -- landscape level) accompanied by a realistic measure of the total uncertainty. Estimates of mangrove \{AGB\} in Kenya are presented at the plot, regional and landscape level accompanied by 95% prediction intervals. The 95% prediction intervals for landscape level estimates of total \{AGB\} stocks suggest that between 5.4 and 7.2 megatonnes of \{AGB\} is currently held in Kenyan mangrove forests. },

@article{Alongi2011,
	Abstract = {Natural ecosystem change over time is an often unconsidered issue for PES and REDD+ schemes, and a lack of consideration of thermodynamic limitations has led to misconcep- tions and oversimplifications regarding ecosystem services, especially for tropical man- grove forests. Mangroves are non-linear, non-equilibrium systems uniquely adapted to a highly dynamic boundary where shorelines are continually evolving and sea-level ever changing, and rarely conform to classical concepts of forest development and succession. Not allmangroves accumulate carbon and rates of forest floor accretion are directly linked to the frequency of tidal inundation. Carbon payments in either a PES or REDD+ scheme are dependent on the rate of carbon sequestration, not the size ofCstocks, so site selection must be ordinarily confined to the sea edge. Gas emissions and net ecosystem production (NEP) are linked to forest age, particularly for monospecific plantations. Planting of mixed-species forests is recommended to maximize biodiversity, food web connectivity and NEP. Old- growth forests are the prime ecosystems for carbon sequestration, and policy must give priority to schemes to maintain their existence. Large uncertainties exist in carbon seques- tration potential of mangroves, and such limitations must be factored into the design, timeframe and execution of PES and REDD+ schemes. \#},

	Abstract = {Coastal wetlands can have exceptionally large carbon (C) stocks and their protection and restoration would constitute an effective mitigation strategy to climate change. Inclusion of coastal ecosystems in mitigation strategies requires quantification of carbon stocks in order to calculate emissions or sequestration through time. In this study, we quantified the ecosystem C stocks of coastal wetlands of the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We stratified the SKBR into different vegetation types (tall, medium and dwarf mangroves, and marshes), and examined relationships of environmental variables with C stocks. At nine sites within SKBR, we quantified ecosystem C stocks through measurement of above and belowground biomass, downed wood, and soil C. Additionally, we measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the soil and interstitial salinity. Tall mangroves had the highest C stocks (987$\pm$338 Mg ha) followed by medium mangroves (623$\pm$41 Mg ha), dwarf mangroves (381$\pm$52 Mg ha) and marshes (177$\pm$73 Mg ha). At all sites, soil C comprised the majority of the ecosystem C stocks (78-99\%). Highest C stocks were measured in soils that were relatively low in salinity, high in P and low in N∶P, suggesting that P limits C sequestration and accumulation potential. In this karstic area, coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, are important C stocks. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of Sian Ka'an covering ≈172,176 ha may store 43.2 to 58.0 million Mg of C.},

@article{Pendleton2012,
	Abstract = {Recent attention has focused on the high rates of annual carbon sequestration in vegetated coastal ecosystems--marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses--that may be lost with habitat destruction ('conversion'). Relatively unappreciated, however, is that conversion of these coastal ecosystems also impacts very large pools of previously-sequestered carbon. Residing mostly in sediments, this 'blue carbon' can be released to the atmosphere when these ecosystems are converted or degraded. Here we provide the first global estimates of this impact and evaluate its economic implications. Combining the best available data on global area, land-use conversion rates, and near-surface carbon stocks in each of the three ecosystems, using an uncertainty-propagation approach, we estimate that 0.15-1.02 Pg (billion tons) of carbon dioxide are being released annually, several times higher than previous estimates that account only for lost sequestration. These emissions are equivalent to 3-19\% of those from deforestation globally, and result in economic damages of \$US 6-42 billion annually. The largest sources of uncertainty in these estimates stems from limited certitude in global area and rates of land-use conversion, but research is also needed on the fates of ecosystem carbon upon conversion. Currently, carbon emissions from the conversion of vegetated coastal ecosystems are not included in emissions accounting or carbon market protocols, but this analysis suggests they may be disproportionally important to both. Although the relevant science supporting these initial estimates will need to be refined in coming years, it is clear that policies encouraging the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems could significantly reduce carbon emissions from the land-use sector, in addition to sustaining the well-recognized ecosystem services of coastal habitats.},

	Abstract = {Mangroves are highly efficient blue carbon sinks that sequester and store large quantities of carbon in standing stock biomass and sediments for long time periods. The conversion of one hectare of mangrove to shrimp farming in Thailand can release 330 mt CO2e/ha/yr. Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-Plus (REDD+) provides international payments and assistance for avoiding anthropogenic emissions from deforestation. REDD+ must compensate land users for lost income. In Thailand, shrimp farming resulted in rapid mangrove deforestation with profits ranging from \$725/ha (low) upwards of \$36,000/ha (high), with an average income of \$6,235.58/ha. Given that one hectare of mangroves grants 231 carbon credits per year, for a low-profit shrimp farmer, the price per ton of CO2e would have to equal \$3.14/mt CO2e. For the average shrimp farmer, a price of \$27.00/mt CO2e makes conservation as profitable as shrimp farming. For a high-profit farmer, the price per ton of carbon must equal \$156.00/ mt CO2e. Prices in existing carbon markets can cover the opportunity costs of marginal shrimp farmers in Thailand despite the high profits of shrimp aquaculture. REDD+ carbon credits and incorporation into existing markets present an opportunity to provide a substantial funding and tangible incentives for mangrove conservation. Deforestation},

	Abstract = {We review 72 published articles to elucidate characteristics of biomass allocation and productivity of mangrove forests and also introduce recent progress on the study of mangrove allometry to solve the site- and species-specific problems. This includes the testing of a common allometric equation, which may be applicable to mangroves worldwide. The biomass of mangrove forests varies with age, dominant species, and locality. In primary mangrove forests, the above-ground biomass tends to be relatively low near the sea and increases inland. On a global scale, mangrove forests in the tropics have much higher above-ground biomass than those in temperate areas. Mangroves often accumulate large amounts of biomass in their roots, and the above-ground biomass to below-ground biomass ratio of mangrove forests is significantly low compared to that of upland forests (ANCOVA, P &lt; 0.01). Several studies have reported on the growth increment of biomass and litter production in mangrove forests. We introduce some recent studies using the so-called ``summation method'' and investigate the trends in net primary production (NPP). For crown heights below 10 m, the above-ground \{NPP\} of mangrove forests is significantly higher (ANOVA, P &lt; 0.01) than in those of tropical upland forests. The above-ground litter production is generally high in mangrove forests. Moreover, in many mangrove forests, the rate of soil respiration is low, possibly because of anaerobic soil conditions. These trends in biomass allocation, NPP, and soil respiration will result in high net ecosystem production, making mangrove forests highly efficient carbon sinks in the tropics. },

	Abstract = {A major paradigm in biosphere ecology is that organic production, carbon turnover and, perhaps, species diversity are highest at tropical latitudes, and decrease toward higher latitudes. To examine these trends in the pantropical mangrove forest vegetation type, we collated and analysed data on above-ground biomass and annual litterfall for these communities. Regressions of biomass and litterfall data show significant relationships with height of the vegetation and latitude. It is suggested that height and latitude are causally related to biomass, while the relationship with litterfall reflects the specific growing conditions at the respective study sites. Comparison of mangrove and upland forest litterfall data shows similar trends with latitude but indicates that mangrove litterfall is higher than upland forest litterfall. The regression equations allow the litterfall/biomass ratio to be simulated, and this suggests that the patterns of organic matter partitioning differ according to latitude.},

@article{Alongi2014,
	Abstract = {Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests of the tropics. They are highly productive ecosystems with rates of primary production equal to those of tropical humid evergreen forests and coral reefs. Although mangroves occupy only 0.5\% of the global coastal area, they contribute 10-15\% (24 Tg C y(-1)) to coastal sediment carbon storage and export 10-11\% of the particulate terrestrial carbon to the ocean. Their disproportionate contribution to carbon sequestration is now perceived as a means for conservation and restoration and a way to help ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions. Of immediate concern are potential carbon losses to deforestation (90-970 Tg C y(-1)) that are greater than these ecosystems' rates of carbon storage. Large reservoirs of dissolved inorganic carbon in deep soils, pumped via subsurface pathways to adjacent waterways, are a large loss of carbon, at a potential rate up to 40\% of annual primary production. Patterns of carbon allocation and rates of carbon flux in mangrove forests are nearly identical to those of other tropical forests.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Mangrove ecosystems could play important ecological, social and economic roles in addressing the mitigation of climate change through reduced deforestation. The present study aimed to estimate ecosystem carbon stocks (carbon accumulated in both biomass and soil) across the tidal gradient of mangroves in Yingluo Bay, Guangdong Province of South China. The ecosystem carbon storage, as well as vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, increased along with the tidal gradient of mangrove forests from the low intertidal zone to the high intertidal zone. The ecosystem carbon storage of the Avicennia marina, Sonneratia apetala, Aegiceras corniculatum + Kandelia obovata, Rhizophora stylosa and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza stands were 212.88 t/ha, 262.03 t/ha, 323.57 t/ha, 443.13 t/ha and 376.80 t/ha, respectively and their vegetation carbon pools accounted for 11.65%, 29.79%, 19.19%, 37.76% and 25.94% of ecosystem carbon storage, respectively. Compared to the mangrove ecosystem, there was a much lower ecosystem carbon stock (97.32 t/ha) at the bare mud flat. The relatively high vegetation biomass, which coupled with carbon-rich soils, resulted in the presence of larger ecosystem carbon stocks compared to other subtropical forests in the same latitude zone. A significant positive correlation was found between vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon concentration of the upper 0--50 cm layers. This may indicate that the increase of vegetation biomass will raise the mangrove-derived \{SOC\} in the soil (especially the 0--50 cm soil layers). Reforestation by using mangrove forests is an important way to increase ecosystem carbon sequestration in coastal areas. },

	Abstract = {Mangroves are among the most threatened and rapidly vanishing natural environments worldwide. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for their exceptional capacity to store carbon. Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO 2 emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO 2 emissions reductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable, localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil carbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive modeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, we construct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 $\pm$ 0.94 Pg C (assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and find this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 $\pm$ 38 Mg C ha −1 ) is roughly a 2.6 $\pm$ 0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 272 $\pm$ 49 Mg C ha −1 ). Considerable within country variation in mangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon stock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5 $\pm$ 0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating benefits from mangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatological predictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim Our scientific understanding of the extent and distribution of mangrove forests of the world is inadequate. The available global mangrove databases, com- piled using disparate geospatial data sources and national statistics, need to be improved.Here,we mapped the status and distributions of global mangroves using recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat archive. Methods We interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes using hybrid super- vised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. Each image was normalized for variation in solar angle and earth--sun distance by converting the digital number values to the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance.Ground truth data and existing maps and databases were used to select training samples and also for iterative labelling. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the published literature to map `true mangroves'. Results The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 75\% of world's mangroves are found in just 15 countries, and only 6.9\% are protected under the existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves is generally confined to the tropical and subtropical regions and the largest percentage of mangroves is found between 5$\,^{\circ}$ N and 5$\,^{\circ}$ S latitude. Main conclusions We report that the remaining area of mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought. Our estimate is 12.3\% smaller than the most recent estimate by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.We present the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest reso lution lution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created.We developed and used better mapping techniques and data sources and mapped mangroves with better spatial and thematic details than previous studies.

	Abstract = {This guide describes a system of cost-effective methods for monitoring, measuring, and verifying carbon storage on on a commercial basis, for three types of land use: forest plantations, managed natural forests, and agroforestry systems. The methods were developed by the Forest Carbon Monitoring Program of Winrock International as a way to provide reliable results using accepted principles and practices of forest inventory, soil science and ecological surveys. The system assesses changes in four main carbon pools: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, soils, and standing litter crops. It aims to assess the net change in each pool for project and non-project (or pre-project) areas over a specified time period. Although carbon monitoring requires specialized equipment and trained personnel, the system aims to minimize the associated costs. The components of the system are: (1) baseline determination of pre-project carbon pools in biomass, soils and standing litter crop; (2) establishment of permanent sample plots for periodic measurement of changes in carbon pools; (3) plotless vegetation survey methods (quarter point and quadrant sampling) to measure carbon stored in non-project areas or areas with sparse vegetation; (4) calculation of the net difference in carbon accumulated in project and non-project land uses; (5) use of satellite images and base maps to gauge vegetation changes; (6) computer software to calculate minimum sample size; (7) computer modelling of changes in carbon storage for periods between field measurements; and (8) a database of biomass partitioning (roots, wood, foliage) for selected species. There is a companion guide, entitled Field Tests of Carbon Monitoring Methods in Forestry Projects.},

	Abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

	Abstract = {Information on net primary production in tropical forests is needed for the development of realistic global carbon budgets, for projecting how these ecosystems will be affected by climatic and atmospheric changes, and for evaluating eddy covariance measurements of tropical forest carbon flux. However, a review of the database commonly used to address these issues shows that it has serious flaws. In this paper we synthesize the data in the primary literature on NPP in old-growth tropical forests to produce a consistent data set on NPP for these forests. Studies in this biome have addressed only a few NPP components, all aboveground. Given the limited scope of the direct field measurements, we sought relationships in the existing data that allow estimation of unmeasured aspects of production from those that are more easily assessed. We found a predictive relationship between annual litterfall and aboveground biomass increment. For 39 diverse tropical forest sites, we then developed consistent, documented estimates of the upper and lower bounds around total NPP to serve as benchmarks for calibrating and validating biogeochemical models with respect to this biome. We developed these estimates based on existing field measurements, current understanding of aboveground consumption and biogenic volatile organic carbon emissions, and our judgment that belowground production is bounded by the range 0.2-1.2 x ANPP (aboveground NPP). Across this broad spectrum of tropical forests (dry to wet, lowland to montane, nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor soils), our estimates of lower and upper bounds on total NPP range from 1.7 to 11.8 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) (lower bounds) and from 3.1 to 21.7 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) (upper bounds). We also showed that two relationships that have been used for estimating NPP (the Bray-Gorham relationship based on leaf litterfall and the Miami model based on temperature or precipitation) are not valid for the tropical forest biome.},

	Abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees >or= 5 cm diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5\% when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

@article{Aragao2009,
	Abstract = {The net primary productivity (NPP) of tropical forests is one of the most important and least quantified components of the global carbon cycle. Most relevant studies have focused particularly on the quantification of the above-ground coarse wood productivity, and little is known about the carbon fluxes involved in other elements of the NPP, the partitioning of total NPP between its above- and below-ground components and the main environmental drivers of these patterns. In this study we quantify the aboveand below-ground NPP of ten Amazonian forests to address two questions: (1) How do Amazonian forests allocate productivity among its above- and below-ground components? (2) How do soil and leaf nutrient status and soil texture affect the productivity of Amazonian forests? Using a standardized methodology to measure the major elements of productivity, we show that NPP varies between 9.3$\pm$1.3MgCha−1 yr−1 (mean$\pm$standard error), at a white sand plot, and 17.0$\pm$1.4MgCha−1 yr−1 at a very fertile Terra Preta site, with an overall average of 12.8$\pm$0.9MgCha−1 yr−1. The studiedforests allocate on average 64$\pm$3\% and 36$\pm$3\% of the total NPP to the above- and below-ground components, respectively. The ratio of above-ground and below-ground NPP is almost invariant with total NPP. Litterfall and fine root production both increase with total NPP, while stem production shows no overall trend. Total NPP tends to increase with soil phosphorus and leaf nitrogen status. However, allocation of NPP tobelow-ground shows no relationship to soil fertility, but appears to decrease with the increase of soil clay content.},

Se presenta una aproximaci\'{o}n a la cuantificaci\'{o}n monetaria del servicio de almacenamiento de carbono, con el fin de establecer informaci\'{o}n base para las decisiones de su uso. Lo anterior se hizo con base en muestreo de campo de 15 \'{a}rboles de manglar y en mediciones realizadas en cuatro estaciones de monitoreo de la CGSM (Ca\~{n}o Grande, Rinconada, Aguas Negras y Luna) por INVEMAR (2008). Para tal fin, se estim\'{o} la biomasa a\'{e}rea total, las existencias de carbono y de di\'{o}xido de carbono equivalente (CO2 e) discriminada por especie y zona. Los resultados indican que en t\'{e}rminos relativos el bosque de manglar de la CGSM puede almacenar entre 6,9 (la Luna) y 45,7 (Rinconada) t C ha-1 . La valoraci\'{o}n monetaria se encuentran entre US\$ 87,76 y 591,41 t CO2e ha-1 , seg\'{u}n los precios pagados por el Banco Mundial, correspondiente a los Certificados de Emisiones Reducidas (CERs) forestales no permanentes. El valor monetario amplia la importancia de iniciar un proceso que permita incorporar estos beneficios econ\'{o}micos a los actuales mecanismos de mercado y contribuyan a los esfuerzos locales de conservaci\'{o}n.},

	Abstract = {We registered seedling survival and biomass increase for Rhizophora mangle L., Avicennia ger- minans L. and Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f., main mangrove species in the Rancheria River delta, Colombia. Only seedlings of R. mangle were found to survive. We also measured maximum rate of litterfall. We estimated annual litterfall through interpolation within an exponential regression performed with maximum and annual litterfall data published in other sources; the value of annual litterfall for the area was estimated to be 12.9 mgha-1y-1. We found a 7.4 mgha-1y-1 increase in biomass. Litterfall constitutes the larger fraction of the 20.2 mgha-1y-1 productivity of this mangrove. We believe this is a very high value for a forest under unfavorable natural and human conditions, such as high seasonality and continuous use of the forest to feed goats and sheep. We consider that the high productivity is a response to both natural and anthropogenic stress. Rev. Biol. Trop. 55 (1): 11-21. Epub 2007 March. 31.},

	Abstract = {Mangroves are ecologically important and extensive in the Neotropics, but they are visibly threatened by selective logging and conversion to pastures in the Southern Caribbean. The objective of this paper was to summarize the impacts of both threats on forest structure, species composition, aboveground biomass and carbon reservoir, species introgressions, and benthic fauna populations by collating past and current data and by using an interdisciplinary approach in the Urab´a Gulf (Colombia) as a case study.Mangroves in the Eastern Coast have been decimated and have produced unskewed tree-diameter (DBH) distributions due to the overexploitation of Rhizophora mangle for poles (DBH range: 7--17 cm) and of Avicennia germinans for planks and pilings (DBH > 40 cm). Selective logging increased the importance value of the light-tolerant whitemangrove Laguncularia racemosa,also increasing biomass and carbon storage in this species, thus offsetting reductions in other species. Introgressions (cryptic ecological degradation) by L. racemosa and Acrostichum aureum (mangrove fern) and low densities of otherwise dominant detritivore snails (Neritina virginea) were observed in periurban basin mangroves. Finally, basin mangroves were more threatened than fringing mangroves due to their proximity to expanding pastures, villages, and a coastal city. 1.},
